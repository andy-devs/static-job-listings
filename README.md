## My process

### Built with

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   JavaScript

### What I learned

It was very interesting challenge. I learned how to work with data from JSON file, how to render items from array and first tried to implement filter feature. It was a little bit hard to do this with vanilla JS, especially rendering objects, but I enjoyed doing it and learned many things.

### Continued development

In the nearest future, I'll continue to solidify my knowledge in JavaScript and build projects with it.
